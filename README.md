# Zero Nonsense Example of Forecasting with Machine Learning
***
A zero-nonsense example of forecasting future data with machine learning.
***
## Forecasting:
***
Forecasting means you predict where you are about to be. If you have some sales data, you can forecast into the future what is likely to happen
## Machine Learning:
***
In this project, Linear Regression is used to capture the trend of the data
***
# The Data:
***
I used arbitrary data in this project. It is a small dataset.
# What Happens in The Project:
***
A prediction is made based on the historical data. The model is trained and used to make a prediction with 95% confidence. I show clear visualization

I demonstrate model selection, model training, model evaluation, checking assumptions, making predictions, forecasting forward, complex problem-solving, confidence interval calculating, Advanced Python Skills, Advanced Visualization Skills, and clear communication skills.

## My Goal:
***
I have two goals:

1. To show my data science skills
2. To help others learn how to do this, because many of the courses I have taken and the things I have read make it harder than it actually is.

# About Me:
***

I'm Chris Woodward. I am currently seeking opportunities in Florida for data analysis/data science. I am very open to remote work and willing to relocate to another area in Florida under the right circumstances. My salary goal is $70,000 (not including benefits) for data analyst role and higher for a data science role.

You can see all my efforts for continuous learning on my LinkedIn.
